# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The log versioning the plugin versioning will not match as 0.0.0 technically does not match semantic versioning but the headache of trying to change this would be too much.
Instead the changelog reader and automation surrounding plugin PRs will add the  back in 

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.html).
